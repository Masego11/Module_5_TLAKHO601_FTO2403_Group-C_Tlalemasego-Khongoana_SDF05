# [SDF05] Project Brief: Blackjack Game on GitHub

## Project Outline
-In my project I worked along the scrimba challenge to create a blackjack game and increased. the challenge and project deepened my understanding of javascript, including arrays, loops, and objects.

## Challenges

1. **Buttons-align**:
    - I could not get my buttons to align vertically from the instructions provided on the scrimba challenge, so wrapped my button element in an ordered list element and wrapped the <ul> element in a container, which I centered in css.
